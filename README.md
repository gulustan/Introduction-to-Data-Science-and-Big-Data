# Introduction-to-Data-Science-and-Big-Data
The main purpose of the project is to enable me to apply data science algorithms for real-world tasks by
using Python notebook and thus to make me qualified in data science.

Evaluation Criteria
• The technical quality of the work. Are the proposed algorithms or applications clever and
interesting?
• Each technique used in the study will be scored.
o Feature Engineering
o Exploratory Data Analysis
o Data Preparation (Data Cleaning, Handling Outliers, etc.)
o Text Vectorization (CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, Word2Vec, etc)
o Model Building with at least 3 different machine learning models
o Ensemble Learning with the models built (Voting Classifier)
o Parameter Tuning
o Comparative Performance Analysis (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, F-Measure, AUC,
etc.)
• Significance. (Did the authors choose an interesting or a real" problem to work on, or only a small
toy" problem?)
